Obviously this is  strand-type game, that of course probably goes without saying

### FOR PHONES & TABLETS:
PRAEDIUM should display correctly on any modern mobile device. It is intended to be held vertically.

### FOR LAPTOPS & DESKTOPS:
PRAEDIUM will scale its user interface to the width of its browser window, and the player can then set the zoom level of the browser to scale the graphics to the size they most prefer.
